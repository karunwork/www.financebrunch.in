/**
 * Finance Brunch - Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) Calculator Utility
 *
 * Implements deterministic client-side SWP simulation supporting both
 * Monthly and Yearly withdrawal schedules:
 * 
 * 1. Monthly Schedule:
 *    - Effective monthly rate: i = (1 + expectedAnnualReturn / 100)^(1 / 12) - 1.
 *    - Each month: growth is compounded first, then scheduled monthly withdrawal is deducted.
 *    - Capped at available balance (never allows balance to become negative).
 * 
 * 2. Yearly Schedule:
 *    - Annual compound rate: i = expectedAnnualReturn / 100.
 *    - Each year: annual growth is compounded first on opening balance, then scheduled yearly withdrawal is deducted.
 *    - Capped at available balance (never allows balance to become negative).
 * 
 * 3. Both schedules track year-by-year opening balance, growth earned, actual withdrawals,
 *    closing balance, cumulative withdrawals, and exact exhaustion point.
